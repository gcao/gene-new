# AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming):
#
# * before
# * after
# * around
#
# * Can alter arguments
# * Can alter result
# * Can skip run
# * Can trigger retry
# * ...
#
# * AOP for OOP
#   Can be applied to classes and methods
#
# * AOP for functions
#   Can be applied to existing functions (not macros and blocks)
#
# Aspects should be grouped, but how?
# * OOP:
#   on class level
#
# * Functions:
#   on scope/ns level, a new object with same name is created in
#   the ns/scope which stores a reference of the old function object
#
# Design by Contract - can be implemented with AOP
# * precondition
# * postcondition
# * invariant
